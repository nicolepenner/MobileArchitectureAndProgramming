### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I designed an applciation for inventory management. There were many goals and functiuons this application needed to have so that it could function correctly. The first goal is that there should be a database where user login information is housed. If a user logs in with the correct information, it should take the user to the inventory management screen. If the user logs in with incorrect information, or it isn't found, it should alert the user. If a user does not have an account they should be able to create and register for a new one. 

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
